This is my first project EVER!

I decided to convert my resume into HTML/CSS. 
The original resume was created using Google Docs Swiss Template. You may find the original .pdf version linked in the project.
Looking at the design and noticing distinct columns, I chose to use Bootstrap.

Some of the main issues I was facing with my .pdf resume which I wanted to resolve in the .html version were:
- no stylized buttons for links
- "skills" icons were not labelled
- manually having to change colour of each highlighted word

How I resolved these issues:
- created stylized buttons using padding with :hover effect
- used Bootstrap tooltips for each icon
- created a style class="pop" on all highlight elements which needed to change colour

TO DO:
- created a global variable for the highlight colour elements
